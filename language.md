The language I want to use, and the group will use is Rust. I have no earlier experience with Rust, go or something like that, so I am eager to see how it works and how the syntax is. I think programming the elevator project in Rust will have its challenges, but It will be very educational. I think Rust may change my mindset on how to think about concurrent actions, but Iâ€™m sure it will be for the better.
